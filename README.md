# ESC-For-Drones
This project simulates a basic DIY Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) used in Drones (Quadcopters,Hexacopters etc.) circuit using LTspice. It is intended to drive a BLDC motor using PWM control via MOSFET switching. The ESC design follows a simple, low-cost, and beginner-friendly approach aimed at educational and prototyping purposes.

 Features:
- Simulates core ESC functionality using:
- N-channel MOSFETs
- Gate driver logic 
- 3-phase output stage
- PWM input simulation for speed control
- Protection components
- Suitable for integration with Arduino-based designs

 Tools Used
- LTspice
